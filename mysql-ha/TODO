parametrize EVERYTHING. 
so far, this is what i can think of: 
- mysql rc script (done)
- mysql user (done)
- cluster device (done)
every variable that involves a sleep, a threshold, a 'patience' measure, 
all of this should be exported from one place and properly named for the
sake of users' convenience (done)
- add licence information (GPL) to every file header. (pending) 
- verify both variable names and comments to see that everything is 
in ENGLISH LANGUAGE.  (pending)
