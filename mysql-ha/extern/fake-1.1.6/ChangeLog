----------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd November 1999
(Horms)

        * Version 1.1.5
          Translated contacts from zipworld to vergenet
          

----------------------------------------------------------------------

14th November 1999
(Horms)

        * Version 1.1.4
        - Setting locale to other than english caused mac
          address determination to fail.
          

----------------------------------------------------------------------

22nd September 1999
(Horms)

        * Version 1.1.3
        - Running a second instance of fake for the same
          instance-configuration caused the second instance
          to signal the first which in turn signalled the
          second instance to shutdown. USR1 is now used for
          fake to tell other intances to exit without cleaning 
          up to avoid this problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

15th May 1999
(Horms)

        * Version 1.1.2
        - SIGHUP and SIGTERM now cause fake to clean  up and exit.
          Previously SIGHUP was ignored and SIGTERM caused
          fake to log that it was exiting and exit without
          cleaning up. This alows fake to be nicely killed
          by signals as well as by running "fake remove".
          Thanks to Tom Vogt <tv@wlwonline.de> for suggesting
          this as part of his Heart package.

12th February 1999
(Horms)

        - Made Bash 2.0 compliant

----------------------------------------------------------------------

6th January 1999
(Horms)

        * Version 1.1.0
        - Added funtianality to allow "real" mac address
          to be advertised using gratuitous arp as fake
	  is turned off. The mac address is dynamically discovred
	  by running ifconfig on the foreign host. This elimiates
	  the problem of configureing a mac address that becomes
	  obselete and causeing netowrk weirdness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

30th November 1998
(Horms)

	* Version 1.0.2
        - SPOOF_BROADCAST added to config to allow broadcast
	  to be set correctly as ifconfig often guesses wrong

----------------------------------------------------------------------
