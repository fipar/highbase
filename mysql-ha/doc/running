to run this beta version youll need: 

- perl
- perl : DBD : MySQL
- gcc
- gnu make
- bash >=2
- mysql with replication configured for one master and one slave (http://www.mysql.com/doc)

as root: 

untar the release at /usr and cd to the mysql-ha dir just
created. 
cd extern
cd fping*
./configure && make && make check && make install && make clean
cd ../fake*
make patch && make && make install
cd ..
cp mysql.monitor <some-dir-in-your-path>
cd ..
./configuration-menu.sh (some defaults are too big and will make the
takeover last forever, i will fix this for the next release)
./setup_fake.sh
now you can run ./configurator.sh, interactively, to test it, 
or nohup /usr/mysql-ha/configurator.sh
