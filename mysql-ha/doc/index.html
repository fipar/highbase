MySQL is a popular (and great!) Free database, useful for many kinds of application,
and with a very good level of robustness. It has<br>
been in active development for many years, is considered the fastest database
for web applications by many, and counts with<br>
a large user base and excelent developers. You can find out more about it
<a href="http://www.mysql.com">here</a>.<br>
Some time ago, i was in need for transparent clustering support with MySQL,
but couldn't find any application to do this job, so i decided to write my
own. If you have a similar project feel free to contact <a
 href="mailto:fipar@acm.org">me</a> so we can join forces.<br>
 Use the same address to send feature requests (we're still pre-alpha so this
 is the best time to do this!)

news<br>
<ul>
  <li>
  there's a working pre-alpha release for download!. a little bit before
  scheduled time (Thu 08-01). we've placed a runnable pre-alpha release
  on the download's page. go grab it <a
  href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mysql-ha/mysql-ha-pre-alplha-2.tar.bz2?download">here</a>, 
  start testing and sending in those bug reports!.
  </li>
  <li>we have the first release available for download, it is a cvs tarball
  of the work we've done so far. it might run, but it probably won't, and it
  doesn't have much documentation. the idea is that you can see what we're
  doing, 
  send in suggestions, etc. we will have better documentation in two weeks
  and a tested alpha release by the end of the month
  </li>
  <li>i've tagged our code in cvs as PRE-ALPHA-1-UNTESTED today, meaning
  that we have a complete and completely untested version available. we
  haven't even run this once since we haven't been able to set up a
  testing environment yet, expect a tested version in two weeks, and of course, 
  minor code modifications almost everyday, as usual. (22-07-2002)
  </li>
  <li>we began discussing some implementation issues (ip takeover techniques)
  today, if you're interested, keep an eye on the <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=10290">mysql-ha-devel
  list</a> (19-07-2002)</li>
  <li>first files available on cvs today. (19-07-2002)</li>
  <li>project approval. (17-07-2002)</li>

this web site is mantained for informational purposes only, even though news
will be updated as the project evolves, you are encouraged to check the project's
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-ha">sourceforge site</a> often.
<br>
<br>
<br>
highlights: <br>
<ul>
  <li>use of MySQL's builtin replication features to achieve data redundancy.</li>
  <li>support for two nodes, a master and a slave (support for n-node clusters
is in the TODO list, but only after a stable production release is achieved
with this first version).</li>
  <li>use of a cluster IP ('logic' or 'virtual' IP) to present a single server
to the outside world.</li>
  <li>has been in active development since Jun 2002, and expects to have
a beta release by the end of July and a stable one by the end of August.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
things i&acute;ll need in the future:
<ul>
  <li>testers</li>
  <li>packagers</li>
  <li>criticism &amp; good ideas are always welcome</li>
