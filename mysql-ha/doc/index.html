MySQL is a popular (and great!) Free database, useful for many kinds of application,
and with a very good level of robustness. It has<br>
been in active development for many years, is considered the fastest database
for web applications by many, and counts with<br>
a large user base and excelent developers. You can find out more about it
<a href="http://www.mysql.com">here</a>.<br>
Some time ago, i was in need for transparent clustering support with MySQL,
but couldn't find any application to do this job, so i decided to write my
own. If you have a similar project feel free to contact <a
 href="mailto:fipar@acm.org">me</a> so we can join forces.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
highlights: <br>
<ul>
  <li>use of MySQL's builtin replication features to achieve data redundancy.</li>
  <li>support for two nodes, a master and a slave (support for n-node clusters
is in the TODO list, but only after a stable production release is achieved
with this first version).</li>
  <li>use of a cluster IP ('logic' or 'virtual' IP) to present a single server
to the outside world.</li>
  <li>has been in active development since Jun 2002, and expects to have
a beta release by the end of July and a stable one by the end of August.&nbsp;</li>
