# highbase

Highbase was a set of scripts to manage a master/slave MySQL pair for improved availability. The project is *deprecated* and only included here for historical reasons, since I've been locked out of my sourceforge.net account (The original repo can be found at http://sourceforge.net/p/highbase/)
