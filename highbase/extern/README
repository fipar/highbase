software included in this directory is third party software. 
i have verified that this is free software, or at least, that it is
released under a license that permits it's use in source and binary
form. i will check this with the people behind every software before
our first release, but if you are the author of any of these and think
i'm doing something wrong, please contact me at fipar@seriema-systems.com
