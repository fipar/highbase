parametrize EVERYTHING. 
so far, this is what i can think of: 
- mysql rc script (done)
- mysql user (done)
- cluster device (done)
every variable that involves a sleep, a threshold, a 'patience' measure, 
all of this should be exported from one place and properly named for the
sake of users' convenience (done)
- add licence information (GPL) to every file header. (done) 
- verify both variable names and comments to see that everything is 
in ENGLISH LANGUAGE.  (done)
- rethink default values for most sleep times, timeouts, and patience
thresholds, since the takeover was a bit slow for a real life situation (done)
- write an installation script that gets a working installation from the tarball (if
all dependencies are satisfied) (done, needs testing)
- make an RPM release (ultra-pending, hint: checkinstall)
