- Fixed bugs in the startup procedure
- Fixed bugs in the usleep dependency compatibility

03-07-2008
* Imported following updates (rufustfirefly):
  - Changed from MYSQLHA_HOME to HIGHBASE_HOME
  - Renamed executables and scripts to use "highbase" name
  - Converted mysql.monitor script to C version for speed and overhead
  - Fix minor script issues, including portability

05-18-2007
* changed references from MASTER_NODE to CLUSTER_IP in takeover, failover and slave_routine, when it was appropiate
* introduced changes in compat.sh, several main cluster files, and the installation documentation, according to bug
reports 1707251 and 1707212
04-06-2007
* The rc-script releases the CLUSTER_IP when invoked with the stop argument
01-16-2007
* We now properly remove the ssh-agent sock after a hard failure
* We now support threshold times in seconds, milliseconds and microseconds, by using usleep instead of sleep in all places except for the main loops (that
would give administrators the possibility to choke their own MySQL servers, I think..)
* Updated the sample highbase.conf file accordingly

11-13-2006
* Added changes to support sudo

** alpha-0.6.4-1

11-08-2006
* We now start the ssh-agent with configurator and run ssh-add afterwards (even if it's not necessary..). We give the user the option to use a passphrase while creating the public/private key pair

11-07-2006
* Fixed the way CLUSTER_IP is configured in the master node. We now do this in a way that's consistent with the takeover script, and in a way that
the CLUSTER_IP is the primary IP on the master node, and it's 'real' IP is left as an alias 

** alpha-0.6.4

11-06-2006
* Fixed setup_replication.sh: 
	* replicate.do.db wasn't being generated properly due to a hardcoded mysql password
	* replication slave privileged didn't always work due to the hostname not being used in the grant sentence


11-02-2006
* Changed takeover to remove the highbase.pid file, so the rc-script now works properly in all scenarios
* Improved handling of MYSQLHA_HOME

10-30-2006
* Fixed a bug in the nocluster flag handling code
* Fixed a bug in the rc-script: it now starts properly, and stops properly unless the system does a takeover
* Fixed a bug in the ifconfig based takeover
* Fixed the passwordless ssh setup

10-13-2006
* Finished up the X configurator, using wxpython. I've added the wxGlade project to the doc directory (couldn't think of a better location
for it!). 

09-10-2006
* I forgot to update the Changelog :) I'll update it from svn log in alpha-7

10-13-2004
* added security warnings where appropiate (during installation)
* fixed permissions of tarball
* fixed permissions of highbase.conf after it's population
* fixed bug in the installation that prevented the fake tarball from being properly opened

05-08-2003
* Modified slave thread verification to compensate for differences between
MySQL 3.x and MySQL 4.x
* Added blank lines to the top of slave.include and master.include.  I encountered a bug where the last line of my /etc/bashrc didn't have a newline.

12-27-2002
* fixed ifconfig cluster ip release bug (report and fix idea provided by gianfranco)

12-09-2002
* added e-mail notification to common.sh (Mike Dopheide)
* added slave thread verification to slave_routine.sh (Mike Dopheide)

10-30-2002
* installation should now work both for debian and redhat (thank you gianfranco)
* hot slave integration for mysql 4.x (load data from master)
* bugfixes in the instalation and configuration scripts (thanks again to gianfranco)


09-24-2002
* minor changes to eliminate redundant script sourcing (of common.sh) 
* changed logger so syslog lines are tagged 'highbased'
* fixed inconsistency in variable naming for mysql rc script (RC_SCRIPT vs MYSQL_RC)

09-21-2002
* fixed slave_routine so it performs the check against the cluster ip, and not
against the master's actual ip. 
* fixed configurator.sh so that it adds the cluster ip when the cluster is
started.  
* changed configurator.sh so if mysql's service isn't running when the cluster
is started, it is automatically started

09-20-2002 
* fixed rc-script

08-05-2002 
*fixed configuration-menu.sh so it verifies that the global bashrc isn't already modified before changing it

08-05-2002 
* fixed failover invocation, added nohup to the shutdown invocation, this fixed the problem

08-12-2002 
* fixed send_notification syntax bug in eval invocation

08-30-2002 
* added instalation script and fixed some minor bugs in related code
